/**
 * Ethogram — species behavior as data, and the scheduler that runs it.
 * ====================================================================
 *
 * An ethogram is the biologist's catalogue of what an animal does. This one
 * is executable: each species declares its domains and its events, and one
 * scheduler turns that into activity. Nothing here touches the world's own
 * mechanics — encounters, wander, navigation, physics and the intent roll
 * all run exactly as they did. An ethogram only decides which *species-
 * specific* action starts, and when.
 *
 * Three tiers, outermost first:
 *
 *   1. DOMAIN PLAN — where the animal means to be: `land` or `water`. Held
 *      for a dwell window, then re-chosen. The pick is weighted by the
 *      configured share AND by the debt between that share and the time it
 *      has actually spent, so activity converges on the intended split
 *      instead of drifting wherever the dice fall. Still random — managed
 *      random. Tier 1 answers "where", never "what".
 *
 *   2. TRIGGER — what may start, given where the animal actually IS (which
 *      is not always where it planned to be). Each event names one:
 *
 *        enter     first frame inside the event's domain
 *        exit      first frame back out of it
 *        dwell     `after` ms into a visit, once per visit
 *        approach  came within reach of a feature (a tree, a float, a den)
 *
 *      Triggers are edge-gated: they fire once per crossing and re-arm only
 *      after the animal leaves. That is what stops an event re-rolling every
 *      frame while the animal stands still.
 *
 *   3. EVENT — chance, then cooldown, then an optional armed delay, then
 *      `begin`. From there the event's own `drive` runs each frame until it
 *      calls `endEvent`. An event may hold weighted `variants`: one roll
 *      decides whether anything happens, a second decides which flavor.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ADDING A BEHAVIOR to a species that already has an ethogram: append one
 * descriptor to its `events` array. Nothing else in the codebase changes —
 * the states it owns register themselves as "busy" (so the intent roll and
 * the encounter engine leave them alone), and its cooldowns and edge gates
 * are handled for you.
 *
 *   { id: "bark", domain: "land", trigger: "approach", chance: .25,
 *     cool: 20000, states: ["barkstrip"],
 *     near: (a, c) => nearestTree(a, c),
 *     begin(a, c, S, tree) { a.state = "barkstrip"; a.stateUntil = c.now + 4000; },
 *     drive(a, c) { a.vx = a.vy = 0;
 *       if (c.now >= a.stateUntil) endEvent(a, c, { reroll: true, quiet: 900 }); } }
 *
 * ADDING A SPECIES: call defineEthogram("wolf", { domains, events }) in the
 * SPECIES section below. A species with no ethogram is untouched: every
 * entry point here no-ops for it, byte for byte the old behavior.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * CONTRACT for `ctx`, built once per frame by the sim and passed to every
 * hook: { now, dt, def, bounds, world, cfg, rand, isWet, isFreeState,
 *         lakePoint, LAKE }.
 *
 * CONTRACT for an event descriptor:
 *   id       unique within the species
 *   domain   "land" | "water" — where the trigger is evaluated
 *   trigger  "enter" | "exit" | "dwell" | "approach"
 *   chance   0..1, rolled once per trigger crossing
 *   after    (dwell only) ms into the visit before it may fire
 *   near     (approach only) (a, ctx) => feature | null
 *   miss     ms of cooldown when the chance roll fails (default 0)
 *   cool     ms of cooldown after the event ends (default 0)
 *   delay    [min,max] ms to wait after a successful roll before begin
 *   hold     (a, ctx) => bool — an armed delay is dropped if this goes false
 *   states   state names this event owns
 *   begin    (a, ctx, S, feature) => void — set a.state and any fields
 *   drive    (a, ctx, S) => void — runs every frame while a.state is owned
 *   variants weighted alternatives, each with its own states/begin/drive
