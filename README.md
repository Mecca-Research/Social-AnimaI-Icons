# Social-AnimaI-Icons
An interactive, emergent “living desktop” made of animal icons that socialize, argue, help each other, and roam a large map with stations for Food, Water, and Play. Every icon runs a tiny state machine (wander, idle, go-to-station, friendly, fight, flee, separate, cooldown, drag) and forms relationships via last-touch memory (friend or rival).
