![Social Animal Icons — animal emojis roaming a large map with Food, Water, and Play stations. Two pairs are mid‑interaction: red “fight” glows and a green “friendly” glow, while others wander or head to a station.](media/screenshot.png)

An interactive, emergent “living desktop” made of animal icons that socialize, argue, help each other, and roam a large map with stations for Food, Water, and Play. Every icon runs a tiny state machine (wander, idle, go-to-station, friendly, fight, flee, separate, cooldown, drag) and forms relationships via last-touch memory (friend or rival).

Current release: v0.6 — Locked interactions (8s), visible separation, enforced wander cooldown, ally-assist with forced flee, edge warp, big playfield, tuned speeds/needs.

✨ Features

Animal-only icons 🦊🐼🐧… with gentle idle waits and random direction changes.

Large, responsive map with edge warp (touching the boundary warps icon to a random in-bounds spot and heads toward center).

Stations: Food · Water · Play (softly refill needs when nearby).

Social logic

At stations: ~60%/sec attempt to interact per nearby pair.

Play: 70% friendly / 30% fight

Food/Water: 40% friendly / 60% fight

In the wild (off stations): ~40%/sec attempt; 50/50 friendly vs fight.

Interaction lock: friendly or fight locks both icons in place for 8 seconds with vibration (bigger shake for fights).

Separation & cooldown: after locking, icons visibly peel apart (~1.4 s), then wander and cannot re-trigger events for ~4.2–7 s.

Ally assist: a nearby third icon whose last-touch with one fighter was friend will cause the opponent to flee briefly; allies cool down.

Last-touch relationships: each pair keeps only the last interaction tag (friend|rival); Inspector counts friends/enemies from that.

Controls: Pause/Run, Speed slider (decently slow → brisk), Add/Remove Icon (start 8, cap 16), Reset World.

🧠 Behavior Model (quick reference)

Needs drain: slow; icons usually wander instead of camping at stations.

Intent mix: ≈ 67% wandering / 33% station-seeking (periodically re-rolled; intent forced to wander during cooldown).

Drag to intervene: grabbing an icon breaks an ongoing friendly/fight and triggers separation+cooldown.

🖥️ Tech Stack

React 18 + Vite (dev server & production bundler)

Tailwind CSS (compiled at build time, tree-shaken to the classes actually used)

Deployed to GitHub Pages via "Deploy from a branch" — the built site is committed and served directly

The core UI is a single React component (`SocialAnimalsRPG`, in `app/src/SocialAnimalIcons.jsx`) you can drop into any app.

## 🌐 Live Demo & Deployment

**Live:** https://mecca-research.github.io/Social-AnimaI-Icons/

The site is a [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) build (React + Tailwind) published with **GitHub Pages → Deploy from a branch** — no Actions workflow and no build step on GitHub's side. The Vite source lives in [`app/`](app/); `npm run build` compiles it and publishes the result to **both the repo root and [`docs/`](docs/)**, each with a `.nojekyll` file. Because the build uses a relative asset base, the live site renders whether Pages serves the **`/ (root)`** folder or the **`/docs`** folder.

### One-time setup (repo owner)

**Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source: _Deploy from a branch_ → Branch: `main`.** Either folder — `/ (root)` or `/docs` — works, so no need to fuss over the folder dropdown. The site goes live at the URL above within a minute or two.

> The Vite `base` is `./` (relative), so hashed-asset URLs resolve from any served path, and the `.nojekyll` files tell Pages to serve the built files as-is (no Jekyll processing).

### Develop & publish

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # start the Vite dev server (prints a localhost URL)
npm run build    # compile app/ and publish the build to the root + docs/
npm run preview  # preview the production build locally
```

Because Pages serves the committed build, **after changing the app run `npm run build` and commit the updated files** (the root build and `docs/`) for the live site to change. `app/src/` holds the simulation as a drop-in React component (`SocialAnimalIcons.jsx`, which exports `SocialAnimalsRPG`) plus the `App.jsx` and `main.jsx` entry files that mount it.
